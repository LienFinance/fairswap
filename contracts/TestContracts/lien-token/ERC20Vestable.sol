/**
 * @notice Vestable ERC20 Token.
 * One beneficiary can have multiple grants.
 * Grants for one beneficiary are identified by unique ids from 1.
 * When some tokens are deposited to a grant, the tokens are transferred from the depositor to the beneficiary.
 * Tokens deposited to a grant become gradually spendable along with the elapsed time.
 * One grant has its unique start time and end time.
 * The vesting of the grant is directly proportionally to the elapsed time since the start time.
 * At the end time, all the tokens of the grant is finally vested.
 * When the beneficiary claims the vested tokens, the tokens become spendable.
 * You can additionally deposit tokens to the already started grants to increase the amount vested.
 * In such a case, some part of the tokens immediately become vested proportionally to the elapsed time since the start time.
